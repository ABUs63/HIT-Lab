Regarded as the birthplace of Western civilization,
Greece had a long history which can be traced back 
to ancient Greece.However,Greek civilization is the 
general name of some cultures,such as Mycenaean culture,
Athenian culture,Sparta culture and so on.Here are some 
summaries regarding it.First and foremost,it is prosperous political achievements 
it made.With the development of many fields,they formed a 
kind of democratic politics.However,it had some defects.At 
the beginning,it was not everyone democracy,it was male who 
was not slave that could join democratic politics.As time 
went by,Solon,Christine and  Pericles advocated their reforms,
which made contribution to the development of politics.
Additionally,during that period,large amount of men of 
natural science appeared,most of whom are familiar to us.
For example,Euclid,who is the father of Geometry,Diophantine,
who is originator of mathematics,Archimedes,who is the 
founder of hydrostatics.All of them contributed promoting 
science.Last but not the least,drama had a farreaching 
impact on us.In their drama system,drama could be divided 
into two types,comedy and tragedy.As Aristotle said,drama 
included plot,character,thought,language,music and 
spectacle.What is more,it was destiny or morality that 
promote the development of the plot.Drama had a lasting 
and important impact on Western drama culture.
In summary,whether in humanities or natural science,Greek 
civilization had reached high level,which still has influence on us.
