2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.195 ns between u2/Q_reg/C (clocked by clk_pin) and w[2] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.333 ns between u2/Q_reg/C (clocked by clk_pin) and w[1] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.348 ns between u2/Q_reg/C (clocked by clk_pin) and w[3] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.373 ns between u2/Q_reg/C (clocked by clk_pin) and w[0] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to clock(s) clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'clk' relative to clock clk_pin for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'w[0]' relative to clock clk_pin for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks *] 0.000 [get_ports -filter { NAME =~  "*" && DIRECTION == "OUT" }]

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#3 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'w[1]' relative to clock clk_pin for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#4 Warning

XDCH-2#5 Warning

The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'w[3]' relative to clock clk_pin for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
